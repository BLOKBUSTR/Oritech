The bedrock extractor can mine ores from below bedrock at locations where [ore resource nodes](../resources/resource_nodes) are found. This [multiblock](../processing/multiblocks) machine can only operate when placed on resource nodes and must be powered using [enderic lasers](../interaction/enderic_laser).

When in operation, the bedrock extractor mines ores directly below it, covering the entire 3x3 area. Each operation randomly selects one of the blocks below. Not all blocks need to be ore nodes.
