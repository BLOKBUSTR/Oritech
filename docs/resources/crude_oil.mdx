Pockets of crude oil can be found in various underground locations. They are also common near the surface in desert biomes, where they can be seen gushing from the ground.

Crude oil can be processed with a [centrifuge](../processing/centrifuge) (equipped with a [fluid addon](../processing/addons)) to produce plastic sheets or turbofuel.
