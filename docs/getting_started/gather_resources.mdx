You need to gather some resources to begin.

Start by looking for an [ore boulder](../resources/ore_boulder) or go mining. You'll need copper, iron, coal, and [nickel](../resources/nickel).

All Oritech ores generate similar to normal ores in caves. Nickel Ore is found between Y 40 down to Y - 65. Platinum ore is rarely found between Y -2 and Y - 60 in the overworld,
but is also abundant in the end dimension.

Gold, redstone, and a couple of diamonds will also be very useful soon, so make sure to collect them as well.
