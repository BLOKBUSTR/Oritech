You can make [steel](../resources/steel), [electrum](../resources/electrum), and [adamant](../resources/adamant) in a crafting table,
but it wastes resources to do it that way.

<CraftingRecipe
    slots={[
        'coal',
        'coal',
        '',
        'iron_ingot',
        'iron_ingot',
        '',
        '',
        '',
        ''
    ]}
    result="oritech:steel_ingot"
    count={1}
/>

<ModAsset location="oritech:steel_ingot" />

As soon as you can, you will want to build a [pulverizer](../processing/pulverizer) and [foundry](../processing/foundry)
so that you can make alloys more efficiently.
