The nuclear update! Adds nuclear reactors, along with a lot of addition new stuff and improvements:
- Add nuclear reactor variable-sized multiblock (visuals & animation will probably get overhauled soon)
- Add 2 nuke blocks for different sizes
- Add uranium ore / crystal / resource node generation
- Add industrial chiller, new multiblock machine for creating ice
- Add auxiliary processing chamber addon
- Add the ability for the centrifuge to process normal and fluid recipes without having to remove the addon
- Add the option to define a blacklist for the spawner controller (entity tag: 'oritech:spawner_blacklist')
- Add energy transfer amount label to machine UIs
- Add missing fragment forge parity recipes
- Add data driven enderic laser recipes (with JEI/REI/EMI entries)
- Add data driven enderic laser block boosting (using tag: 'c:budding_blocks')

- Improve metal components textures (@BLOKBUSTR)
- Reduce processing times for most machines
- Improve docs for particle accelerators, tree cutters, desert wells, bedrock extractors, and a few more
- Improve drone ports by adding addon slots and allowing fluid transport with fluid addons
- Reduce resource node spawn rates
- Reduce exosuit armor amount to iron-like
- Improve enderic laser visuals, making the beam more centered on the model
- Reduce desert oil well generation rates
- Improve JEI plugin by adding a fluid slot tank background
- Update overcharged crystal collision recipe to use energite instead of electrum
- Reduce pulverizer sound volume
- Update unholy intelligence texture to have a better matching inner color
- Change plastic plates to use the 'c:plates/plastic' tag, update all recipes accordingly

- Fix arcane catalysts not being boostable with enderic lasers
- Fix particle accelerator collisions not being guaranteed in the first pass
- Fix particle accelerator impact energy calculations being affected by gate distance (this might break some existing setups)
- Fix portable fluid tank content tooltip not showing
- Fix portable energy storages not auto-updating comparators
- Fix sounds being played too often for fast/energy-hungry machines
- Fix sounds not being positioned by converting all sounds to mono channel
- Fix possible energy pipe crash
- Fix exo armor / jetpack not having respective armor slot tags
- Fix lasers not getting drops for AE2 certus quartz cluster (@VasariRulez)
- Fix possible fluid insertion issues when changing fluids in centrifuge / fluid generators
- Fix superconductors not always dropping when mined
- Fix super long fragment forge ore processing times
- Fix water display amounts in JEI and EMI recipes
- Fix oritech fluids being fully transparent in some UIs on neoforge (e.g. JEI and Mekanism)
- Fix invalid pipe extraction state updates on neighbor blockupdates (@aderoian)
- Fix crash when using comparators on large energy storages (@aderoian)
- Fix resource node generation issues in some biomes (@aderoian)
- Fix possible crashes when rotating/mirroring machine addons
- Fix possible caching issues with machine core connection when rebuilding machines
